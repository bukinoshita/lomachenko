## What this module has anything to do with box or code?

Lomachenko is known for his excellent hand speed, timing, accuracy, creativity, and foot movement, people call him `The Matrix`. Like `Neo` dodging the bullets.

He's training his brain to process and precisely react with his hands as fast as possible. That's the purpose of this module, to train the brain to process as fast as possible by looking for numbers.

## How it works?

When you run `lomachenko` on your terminal a `shuffled` table 5x5 will be shown to you. Try to look for numbers sequentially as fast as possible.
